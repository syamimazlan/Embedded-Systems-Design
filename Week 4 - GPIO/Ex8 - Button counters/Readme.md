Three switches (A,B and C) are connected to ATmega328p as shown. 

The microcontroller needs to keep track of how many times each
button has been pressed. Whenever any button has been pressed, the
microcontroller needs to send out the information (of how many times
each button has been pressed) through the serial port.

LED is added to show that the push button is accepting inputs.
